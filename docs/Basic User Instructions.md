## Terminology

I'm still working on a more concise terms, but in this application their definitions are as follows:
 
 General Terms:
 
 `Name` - refers to the alarm Name
 
 `Start Location` - refers to the location that the user will start from in their commute
 
 `End Location` - refers to the user's end destination of their commute
 
 `Arrival Time` - refers to the time of day that the user would like to arrive at their specified `End Location`
 
 `Buffer Time` - refers to the amount of time in minutes
that the user would like between the alarm going off and when they need to leave their `StartLocation` in order to reach their `End Location`
by their specified `Arrival Time`


Traffic Modes:

`Optimist` - Estimates of commute times will be shorter

`Pessimist` - Estimates of commute times will be longer
