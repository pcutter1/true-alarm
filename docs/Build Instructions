# To Build

## Clone/Download the repository

1. Find the [True Alarm](https://github.com/pcutter1/true-alarm) app on Github
2. Click the `CODE` button and click 'Clone with SSH' and then copy the git@github address to the clipboard (this can be done by clicking the clipboard icon next to the address)
3. Import the application directly from an IDE such as IntelliJ by selecting New Project -> 'Import From Version Control' and pasting the copied link.
4. The Google Maps API SECTION
  
     4.1 This application requires a valid Google Maps API key to run properly.
     In order to procure one, please follow the detailed steps listed on the Google Developers site [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
    
     4.2 Once you have a valid API key, you will need to copy the key into a text editor in the following format on line 1
    
     `API_KEY=[YOUR_API_KEY]`
     
     Then save the file as a `.properties` file in a `/Desktop/projects/services` directory.
     
5. At this point you should be able to successfully build and run the True Alarm application.
